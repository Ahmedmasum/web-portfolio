          I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed
          to make a website function,efficient.I didn't stop with that.I went
          beyond with some other populer javascript framework like React js and
          Vue js. I also know how to deploy any web application, and modify it
          from any git hub repository.

        <p>
          They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as remote web developer.
          I made their websites and showed it to them.They liked and uploaded
          the content.It was fun working at Programming Hero.
